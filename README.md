# ZBosonDetection
This repository is dedicated to a project I completed in my senior year at UCLA. Utilizing open source data from the CMS Detector at the Large Hadron Collider, I was able to rediscover the Z boson. I have included my final paper on the particle physics theory that was necessary in order to prove the Z boson was present in the Proton-Proton collisions at the LHC. Unfortunately at this moment I only have my first draft of the code that I wrote to complete this project as the entire project was done in the CERN-CMS Virtual Machine which I no longer have access to. The final project adds many more restrictions on the data that isolate the Z bosons created in the P-P collisions which are explained in the paper.
